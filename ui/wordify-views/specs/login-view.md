# Login View

We need a view that can be used to instruct the user to login

# Configuration

The view should accept a configuration value of a 'message' string which is used to display the reason the user needs to log in. For example, a message might be displayed saying "Log in to join this lobby."

# Behaviour

There should be a 'Login' button which when clicked goes to the /auth/page/oauth0/forward route.

# Responsiveness Concerns

This view should display well on mobile and desktop
